description: 'Implement one GitHub issue end-to-end for the Torī Valley Scoreboard repo — branch, tests first, pnpm lint/typecheck/test/build green, visual check for UI changes, doc updates, PR referencing "Closes #N". Use when told to "develop" / implement a ticket. This is the R2 step in doc/technical/automation-plan.md — one run, one issue, never a batch.'

# Implement Task

Executes a single GitHub issue's spec (written by `issue-to-spec`) as one
branch, one commit, one PR. See `project-conventions` for the layering and
backward-compat rules referenced throughout.

## Picking the issue

If not told which issue, take the first open issue labeled `ready` and not
assigned, highest priority first (`P0` > `P1` > `P2` > `P3`). Add the
`in-progress` label before starting.

## Workflow

1. **Read the spec fully** — context, acceptance criteria, impacted files,
   out-of-scope. If the spec is ambiguous or missing acceptance criteria,
   stop and ask rather than guessing scope.
2. **Branch from the latest default branch**: `feat/<issue-number>-<slug>`
   (slug = a few kebab-case words from the title).
3. **Tests first.** Write the test(s) that encode the acceptance criteria
   before the implementation — colocated `*.test.ts(x)` next to the file
   under test, per repo convention. They should fail before step 4 and pass
   after.
4. **Implement**, respecting layering: Reducer in `ui/*/` (pure), Use Case in
   `application/` (zero framework dependency), Repository interface in
   `domain/port/`, implementation in `infrastructure/`. Any new field on a
   serialized model gets a zod `.default()`; any removal/rename gets a
   migration note (create `doc/technical/migrations.md` if it doesn't exist
   yet).
5. **Verify green**: `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build`
   — all four, not a subset. This mirrors what `ci.yml` will run on the PR;
   catch failures here rather than in CI.
6. **Visual check for UI changes.** If the issue touches a screen
   (`src/ui/*/`), start the dev server and exercise the actual flow in a
   browser — golden path and the edge cases named in the acceptance
   criteria. Don't claim a UI change works from tests alone.
7. **Update `doc/`** per `CLAUDE.md`'s Pre-commit Checklist: the matching
   `doc/reference.md` table row, `doc/functional/feature.md` or
   `doc/functional/features/*.md` for user-facing behavior,
   `doc/technical/migrations.md` for schema changes. A diff that adds a
   reducer/use case/model/port/adapter/screen without a matching doc update
   is not done yet.
8. **One commit.** Message = the issue's title (see `CLAUDE.md`'s good/bad
   commit examples — describe the *why*, not "Fix" or "Update").
9. **Push and open a PR** with `Closes #N` in the body, so the issue closes
   automatically on merge.
10. **Label `auto`** only if the issue's spec marked risk as **Low**
    *and* the actual diff still matches that (re-check: did this PR end up
    touching a serialized model, a port/adapter, `public/`, Vite/TS config,
    or navigation despite the spec's prediction? If so, don't add `auto` —
    the diff overrides the prediction).
11. Move to the next `ready` issue rather than batching multiple issues into
    one PR.

## Guardrails

- If mid-implementation the change turns out to need more files than the
  spec listed, that's fine — but if it turns out to be a fundamentally
  different or much larger change than the spec described, stop and flag it
  rather than silently expanding scope.
- Don't merge the PR yourself. Merging is deterministic tooling
  (`gh pr merge --auto --squash` once checks are green and `auto` is
  present), not part of this skill.
