description: Review a Torī Valley Scoreboard PR against its issue's spec — subjective checklist only (spec conformance, hexagonal architecture, zod backward-compat, doc freshness, debt introduced). Everything mechanical is already covered by ci.yml (lint/test/build/doc-links) — do not re-check those. Use when asked to review a PR in this repo, or as the R3 step in doc/technical/automation-plan.md.

# PR Review

Reviews what CI structurally cannot: whether the diff actually satisfies the
issue it claims to close, and whether it's honest about the repo's
architecture and backward-compat rules. See `project-conventions` for the
rules this checklist is built on.

## Out of scope — don't re-check these

`ci.yml` already runs `lint`, `test`, `build`, `doc-links` on every push. Redoing
that by eye wastes the review on things a machine already verified with
certainty. If CI is red, that's a blocker on its own — no need to also
narrate it here.

## Checklist

1. **Spec conformance.** Open the linked issue (`Closes #N`). Does the diff
   satisfy every acceptance criterion? Is anything in the PR outside the
   issue's stated scope (scope creep, even well-intentioned) — should be
   called out.
2. **Hexagonal architecture respected.**
   - Reducers (`ui/*/`) stay pure — no repository calls, no use-case
     construction inside a reducer.
   - Use cases (`application/`) have zero framework dependency (no React
     imports, no DOM/localStorage access directly — that belongs behind a
     port).
   - New repository access goes through a `domain/port/` interface with the
     implementation in `infrastructure/`, not a direct call from application
     code.
3. **Backward-compat of serialized models.** For any change to
   `Player`/`Match`/`PlayerResult`: does every new field have a zod
   `.default()` in the matching `*.schema.ts`? Is every removed/renamed
   field documented in `doc/technical/migrations.md`? A missing default or
   an undocumented removal is a blocker, not a nit.
4. **Doc freshness.** Cross-check the PR's file changes against `doc/`: new
   reducer/use case/model/port/adapter/screen → matching `doc/reference.md`
   row and functional doc updated. If the code changed and the doc didn't,
   say which file is now stale.
5. **Debt introduced.** New `TODO`s, disabled tests, silenced type errors,
   copy-pasted logic that should have been a shared helper, a shortcut that
   only works for the happy path from the issue's examples. Flag it even if
   it's not blocking — that's the point of a subjective review.

## Output

State a verdict per item: conforms / doesn't conform / N/A, with a one-line
reason. End with an overall verdict:

- **Conforms** — nothing above blocks merge.
- **Needs changes** — list exactly what, scoped tightly enough that
  `address-feedback` can act on it without re-deriving the spec.

Don't soften a real blocker into a "nit" to avoid friction — a review that
never says no isn't protecting anything (see `automation-plan.md`'s risk
table: "review with no teeth").

## Posting the verdict (interactive only — R3's automation isn't built here)

This repo has no `needs-review`/`review-pass`/`needs-fix` labels and no
`review-status-sync.yml` — unlike scoreo, the label-based translation into a
`claude/review` commit status is a documented future phase
(`automation-plan.md` §7, Phase 2), not running infrastructure. For now,
just post the verdict as a PR comment (or say it directly to the user, for
an ad hoc review) — don't invent labels or workflow steps that don't exist
in this repo.

If Phase 2 gets built later (the two GitHub Actions plus the label set),
this section should be updated to match scoreo's mechanism instead of
restating it speculatively now.
